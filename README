V1190B_server runs on BIVME2 VME controller, performs initialization and retrieves data from V1190B Caen time-digit converter,

COMPILATION
The server can be compiled with .
The file with this framework is usually called powerpc-sdk-linux-v4.tgz
Compilation instructions:
1. tar -xzf powerpc-sdk-linux-v4.tgz
2. export PPC860_BASE=`pwd`/ppc860
3. cd folder_V1190B
4. make Release

The last step will create an executable V1190B_server in Release subfiolder.

INSTALL
Server can be copied to BIVME2 and registed with xinetd throug it's configuration files.
The actual configuration may look like:
/etc/xinetd.d/daq:
service daq
{
    socket_type     =  stream
    wait            =  no
    user            =  root
    server          =  /home/bin/daq
    log_on_success  += DURATION USERID
    log_on_failure  += USERID
    type            =  UNLISTED
    disable         =  no
    port            =  1055
}

/home/bin/daq:
#!/bin/sh
killall -SIGINT V1190B_server > /dev/null 2>/dev/null
/home/bin/V1190B_server 2>/tmp/beam_daq.log
# Error output redirection is neccessary to keep binary stream on standard one intact.  

USAGE
After xinetd restart it should accept connections on port 1055 and transmit binary data from  V1190B_server to connected clients.
V1190B_client to connect and interpret.
